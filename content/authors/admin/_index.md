Hi, I'm Jonathan,

I want to help make the forests and forest businesses better...

I've always loved forests, technology, and computers and I've spent a large part of my career following these passions. Following a degree in Biology and a Masters degree in forest growth and yield modelling in the UK I moved to New Zealand in 2007. I spent the next decade working in the vibrant forest sector and as a forestry scientist. I worked at an innovative consulting and forest measurement company where I was exposed to all aspects of forest measurement and modelling, sampling design, forest measurement, and learned SQL for database management. I worked on various research projects including remote sensing and harvesting research. I also contributed to the development of New Zealand's national forest carbon inventory.

I then moved to the NZ Forest Research Institute (Scion) as a Forestry and Remote Sensing Scientist where I helped develop a leading Geomatics team carrying out cutting edge research into forest remote sensing. In my research I worked with Lidar, photogrammetry, multispectral and hyperspectral sensors and have developed deep expertise and coding skills to process these datasets. I also led the development of a state-of-the art heavy lift UAV capability to carry our sensors. I have also extensively used satellite imagery and conventional aerial imagery and laser scanning for both research and in the real world.   

I have expertise in forest management, remote sensing, natural resource sampling and statistics. I have substantial experience of working in both academic research and commercial forestry where I turn my analytical skills to solving real world problems for a wide range of clients. I am an expert in sampling design and statistical modelling for forestry and have developed a wide range of forest growth and yield simulation tools for my clients. I am uniquely positioned to offer insight into the accuracy of forest yield prediction systems and identify and implement improvements. I have done this for clients throughout the world. 

I have the technical skills to handle all aspects of processing remote sensing data to provide meaningful insights. I have delivered many successful projects including lidar-based forest inventories, satellite monitoring of forest condition and land cover, and mapping of forest risks such as wildfire and forest pathogens. 

I help my clients use research outputs in their businesses. 

Please take a look through my Publications, Projects and download my CV for more detail.

If you need help on technical aspects of any project please contact me.
